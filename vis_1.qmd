# Unemployment Rate in London Over Time

## Context & Question

This visualization shows how the unemployment rate in London changes over years and across months.

The goal is to identify long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and major economic shocks for the labour market.

## Design Decisions

A heatmap is used to display unemployment rates across two time dimensions: year and month.

Color intensity encodes the unemployment rate, allowing quick comparison across periods.

This design highlights patterns effectively, though it does not show individual borough differences.

We could use a line chart as an effective tool for representing time patterns, but heatmap is more usefull for considering two time dimensions.

## Key Insights

Unemployment rates decline steadily after the early 2010s, indicating improving labor market conditions.

A clear spike appears around the COVID-19 period, representing the strongest increase in unemployment.

Seasonal variation is present, but it is smaller than the impact of major economic shocks.
