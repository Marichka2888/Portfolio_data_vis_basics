<h1> Changes in Social and Economic Conditions in London Over Time</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This portfolio explores key social and economic conditions in London and how they have changed over time.Using housing, labor market, transport, air pollution, and health data, the visualizations examine different dimensions of quality of life in the city.Together, they highlight how long-term trends and external shocks, such as the COVID-19 period, can affect living conditions and urban dynamics.The goal of this portfolio is to provide a data-driven overview of how economic, environmental, and social factors interact in a large urban area.
</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
Across all visualizations, the COVID-19 period stands out as the most significant disruption, causing sharp and simultaneous changes in economic, environmental, and demographic indicators. Public transport usage dropped dramatically during the pandemic regardless of transport type, with cable cars remaining the least used and busses consistently the most important type of mobility. Economic stress is clearly visible through spikes in unemployment. Environmental indicators show temporary improvements during reduced mobility, while demographic trends such as life expectancy reveal longer-term patterns that were only partially affected by COVID-19 (hardly captured difference).

Overall, the visualizations demonstrate that while long-term trends matter, extreme events like the pandemic can rapidly reshape urban systems across multiple dimensions.
